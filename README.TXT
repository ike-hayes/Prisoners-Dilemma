PROJECT TITLE: Prisoners Dilemma
VERSION or DATE: 23/08/21
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Create a new instance of the 'Game' class
AUTHORS: Ike Hayes
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The prisoner's dilemma is a classic paradoxical game,
in which it might appear to be better to act selfishly, but cooperating with
your opponent helps you both. This is a game version in which you can play both 
offline with computer opponents and online with friends.
